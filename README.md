# RevuMe

A private review application that allows users to leave reviews for places, foods, movies, books, and more for their own information. Made with a React frontend and a Python backend, and fully open source.

## Live app

- Frontend: https://revumeapp.netlify.app
- Backend: https://revume-api.onrender.com

The project runs on the free tiers of Netlify and Render. Render automatically puts the backend to sleep after 15 minutes without traffic, so the first request may take a little longer while it wakes up. If you need to ensure it is awake, open the backend URL once before using the site.
